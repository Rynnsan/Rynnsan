## 🧭 About Me

I’m currently learning and experimenting across different areas of programming,  
with a growing interest in:

- 🧠 Software structure, modularity, and clean code principles  
- 🧪 Backend development using Python & Django  
- 🌐 Frontend fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS — learning by building)  
- 🎮 Interactive systems and game engines like Godot  

Most of my projects are learning-oriented — I build to **understand**, not just to finish.

## 📌 Current Focus

- Building a **Reddit sentiment tracker** as a way to explore NLP and web development  
- Diving deeper into **how systems work** — not just what they do  
- Treating AI coding tools (like Copilot or Claude) as thought partners, not crutches

## 🧠 Guiding Principle

> *“The difference between hacking and engineering is understanding.”*
